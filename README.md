# hello-world
My first repository for general programming, opportunities for communication, and hopefully looking for experts to teach me programming.


Hello everyone!

My name is jkoolz, I am a DJ and am looking into learning more about software engineering and development.
I have some experience in Java and am aware of some of the syntax in the languages of Python and Swift but I want to learn so much more about each of them as well as C++, SQL, and C#.
